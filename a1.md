1. Data structure and algorithm design

   We created a class Crossword which have three properties:

   - board: store the initial board loaded from the board file(board file is indicated by command-line argument)
   - dict: instance of DictInterface interface, used to encapsulate the operation on dictionary
   - solution: 2D-array of characters, used to store solution of the crossword puzzle
   - letterPoint: hash map, map letter to it's score

   In the static main method of Crossword:

   - We first get the dict file name and board file name from the command-line arguments;
   - Then we load all the words from dictionary file and add them into the attribute dict  of crossword object, and load the board from board file, store the board into the arrtribute board of crossword object, load the letter point to the hashmap letterPoint;
   - We created two StringBuilder arrays that are used to backtracking;
   - Then we use backtracking algorithm to search all the possibilities of the puzzle until we found one solution, when we found the solution, we store the solution into the solution attribute of crossword object.
   - After we found the solution, we call the method: computeScore to compute the score of the filled puzzle

   Idea of the method backTrackingSearch:

   - If the current position has determined, i.e. current position is already filled, we check if the current board is valid, we keep search if it is, otherwise, we back to the upper level, try other possibilities
   - If the current position is not determined, we try every possibilities, and also in every move, we need to check if the filled charater make the board invalid, if the board is invalid, we remove the current filled character, and try to put other character at the current position and test again. If the board is valid after current move, we search for the next position.

   Idea of the method computeScore:

   - First we need to load the letter point from the file letterpoint.txt
   - When we finish the search, we traverse the solution, add the letter point

2. Problems and Bugs

   The search can unbearable slow for the larger board(e.g 8x8), the slowness of the program comes from two ways:

   - The prefix search is linear search, which is very slow
   - The backtracking search itself is very slow too, since we need to fill all the position one by one and try every possibilities until we found one solution

3. Run-time analysis

   Assume the side length of board is N

   | Board file | Run-time                                              |

4. Worst-case run-time analysis

   Assume the number of words in the dictionary is ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\N_{\text{word}}), the number of empty space in the board is ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\N_{\text{board}}), the max length of the word is L, the maximum run-time complexity of prefix search of the word is ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\L*N_{\text{word}}), in the worst case, we will try every possibilities of the board, therefore the total run-time complexity is:
   
   ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\O(L*N_{\text{word}}*27^{N_{board}}))
